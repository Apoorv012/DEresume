# DEresume
 Validating Resume using Ethereum
# Description
Imagine a world where resumes are not just documents but verifiable proof of professional achievements. Enter our solution, utilizing Soul-Bound-Tokens (SBTs), a digital token system. Organizations issue SBTs representing specific experiences. Applicants securely store these in blockchain wallets, crafting resumes dynamically from chosen SBTs. Employers gain trust in the hiring process by reviewing resumes backed by tamper-proof SBTs. Join us in shaping the future of transparent and trustworthy professional credential verification.
