Compilation Command:

To compile your Solidity contracts, we can use the following command: 
npx hardhat compile
This will compile the contracts and generate the artifacts in the artifacts/ directory.


Command for deployment of contracts in hardhat environment:

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your_network>
Replace <your_network> with the desired network, such as rinkeby, mainnet, etc.
