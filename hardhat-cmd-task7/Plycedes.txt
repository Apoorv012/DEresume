Command to Compile:
npx hardhat compile

Command to deploy the smart contract in this project:
npx hardhat run ./connections/deploy.js --network [network-name]

Furthermore we can also use "hardhat-deploy-ethers" package to add an inbuilt deploy task to 
the hardhat.
After adding this package we can create a directory with the name "deploy" and put all of our
deploy scripts in that directory and run the command

npx hardhat deploy

And the "hardhat-deploy-ethers" package will look for the "deploy" directory and execute every
single script in that directory.
